//1) install pacakges -> redux react-redux
//2) creation of  the store
      //a) reducer 
//3) Connect your app to the store.(Provider)
//4 make actions and reducers
//5 trigger action from component

//SWITCH(ACTION_TYPE):
//case GET_ALL_STUDENT_DATA:
//return all syudent data//
//case GET_TOP_STUDENT_DATA:
//return Top Students 
//store -> store is something which keeps your data.
//reducer -> a function which returns data from the store.(state) based on the action type
//actiontype -> GET_ALL_STUDENT_DATA
//action type -> GET_TOP_STUDENT_DATA

//Component -> Trigger a action with actiontype GET_TOP_STUDENT_DATA -> Action will call the reducer -> Reducer will go to Store and get the data -> data will be retuned to component
//actioncreator
//dispatch
//select
//Provider -> gives access to the store
//middleware -> actions and reducers(why middleware is used in redux??)

// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function
// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))
// or send to an analytics endpoint. Learn more: https://bit.ly/CRA-vitals
reportWebVitals();

//Make a reactive form -> two inputs Name and Email Id a radio button will be for gender a checkbox(Are you married) input label
